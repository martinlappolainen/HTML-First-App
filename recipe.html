        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> a drizzle of olive oil in a large non-stick frying
            pan and crumble in the mince and sausagemeat. 
            Spend a good 30 mins cooking the mince – it will release lots of liquid,
            which you want to evaporate, and then eventually it will end up sizzling 
            in its own fat. If the pan becomes too dry, drizzle in a little more olive oil.
            Towards the end, continue stirring the mince until it becomes speckled with crisp 
            brown bits</li>
            <li>Heat oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 2. While the mince is browning, heat a drizzle 
            more oil in a casserole dish and sizzle the pancetta for 5 mins until it starts to brown 
            and release its fat, then throw in the vegetables and herbs, and finely crumble over the 
            dried porcini. Cook gently for 5 mins until soft and starting to brown. Sprinkle over the
             sugar, then stir in the tomato purée and splash in the fish sauce and vinegar. Simmer down 
             until gloopy, then stir through the meat and pour in the milk and tomatoes. Rinse out the 
             tomato tins with the wine and stir into the pan. Season, then nestle in the parmesan rind. 
             Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook in the oven for 3 hrs.</li>
